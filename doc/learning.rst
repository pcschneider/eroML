Classification
====================================


Relevant Properties
-------------------
The following properties are used to differentiate between real stellar associations and non-stellar sources or random matches.

1. Positional match
    The match distance is first transfered in sigma units and then log(1-cdf) is used
    
2. Gaia magnitude (or rather flux)
    In log-units (+11)

3. X-ray flux
    In log-units (+13)
    
4. Parallax
    In log(value)

5. Gaia color
    In mag
    
6. Local sky density of eligible counter parts
    As 1/(number of sources within 3 arcmin)
    
Classes
----------------------

The following three classes exist
  
  0) Stars
  1) Others
  2) Random matches
